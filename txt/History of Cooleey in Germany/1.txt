Origin in 1984 and the concept of “firming skin and reducing wrinkles”
In 1984, a team of engineers from Global Cosmeceutical Technology GmbH proposed to transform the results of cellular anti-aging into actual anti-aging skincare effects, namely “firming skin and reducing wrinkles”. This concept was inspired by the cell theory of the famous German scientist Virchow. As a result, they developed the first medical-grade skincare product with “firming skin and reducing wrinkles” as the core and created Cooleey.
